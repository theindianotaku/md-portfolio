- Built-in dark mode support without external dependencies

**Content Management**: MDX with Advanced Plugin Ecosystem
```javascript
// next.config.mjs - MDX Configuration
const withMdx = nextMdx({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      remarkGfm,                    // GitHub Flavored Markdown
      remarkAlert,                  // GitHub-style alerts
      remarkFrontmatter,            // Frontmatter extraction
      remarkMdxFrontmatter,         // MDX frontmatter support
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [
      rehypeSlug,                   // Auto-generate heading IDs
      rehypeAutolinkHeadings,       // Auto-link headings
      rehypeExtractToc,             // Table of contents extraction
      rehypeExtractTocMdx,          // MDX TOC support
      rehypeHighlight,              // Syntax highlighting
    ],
  },
});
```

### Content Architecture

**Dynamic Content Discovery**:
```typescript
// src/lib/blog.ts - Content Management System
export async function getAllBlogPostsMetadata(): Promise<BlogPostMetadata[]> {
  const slugs = getBlogSlugs();
  const posts = await Promise.all(
    slugs.map((slug) => getBlogPostMetadata(slug))
  );

  // Sort by date (newest first)
  return posts.sort(
    (a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime()
  );
}
```

**Tag-Based Categorization**:
The portfolio implements automatic content categorization based on frontmatter tags:
- `case-study`: Detailed project narratives
- `project-deep-dive`: Technical implementation deep-dives
- `article`: General technical articles
- `mini`: Quick thoughts and insights

### Performance Optimizations

**Image Optimization Strategy**:
```jsx
// Multiple format support with WebP fallbacks
<picture>
  <source srcSet="/assets/images/hero.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcSet="/assets/images/hero.png" type="image/png" />
  <img src="/assets/images/hero.png" alt="Hero image" loading="eager" />
</picture>
```

**Font Optimization**:
```typescript
// Strategic font loading with variable fonts
const sansFont = IBM_Plex_Sans({
  variable: '--font-sans',
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['200', '400', '700'],  // Only required weights
});

const serifFont = Merriweather({
  variable: '--font-serif',
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['300', '400', '900'],  // Selective weight loading
});
```

**Bundle Optimization**:
- Tree-shaking of unused Tailwind classes
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Minimal JavaScript footprint (< 100KB total bundle)

## Design System Implementation

### Color Philosophy & Implementation

The design centers around carefully chosen green tones that reflect growth and tranquility:

```css
/* Light theme - Emerald Green */
:root {
  --color-primary: #046A38;
  --color-accent: #059669;
  --color-highlight: #065f46;
}

/* Dark theme - Jade Green */
.dark {
  --color-primary: #00A86B;
  --color-accent: #10b981;
  --color-highlight: #34d399;
}
```

These colors were chosen not just for aesthetics, but for their:
- **Accessibility**: All combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
- **Psychological Impact**: Green conveys growth, stability, and harmony
- **Personal Connection**: Reflects my affinity for jade aesthetics from gaming and culture

### Typography System

**Typographic Hierarchy**:
```css
/* Custom typography scale */
.prose h1 { @apply text-3xl font-serif font-light; }
.prose h2 { @apply text-2xl font-serif font-light text-highlight; }
.prose h3 { @apply text-xl font-semibold; }

/* Reading optimization */
.prose p { 
  @apply leading-relaxed text-base;
  line-height: 1.75; /* Optimized for readability */
}
```

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Breakpoint System**:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.mjs - Custom breakpoints
screens: {
  sm: '375px',    // Mobile-first approach
  md: '768px',    // Tablet
  lg: '1200px',   // Desktop
}
```

**Container Strategy**:
```css
.container {
  center: true;
  padding: {
    DEFAULT: '1rem';
    md: '2rem';
  };
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Table of Contents Generation

Implemented automatic TOC generation for long-form content:

```jsx
// Dynamic TOC from MDX content
<TableOfContents 
  items={tableOfContents} 
  className="sticky top-20 max-h-screen overflow-y-auto" 
/>
```

### SEO Optimization

**Structured Data Implementation**:
```javascript
// JSON-LD for enhanced search engine understanding
const jsonLd = {
  '@context': 'https://schema.org',
  '@type': 'Person',
  name: 'Debashish Nayak',
  jobTitle: 'Frontend Engineer',
  description: 'Building Clean & Accessible Web Experiences.',
  sameAs: [
    'https://github.com/theindianotaku',
    'https://www.linkedin.com/in/debashishnayak/',
  ],
};
```

**Meta Tag Optimization**:
- Dynamic Open Graph images for each article
- Twitter Card support for social sharing
- Proper canonical URLs and meta descriptions

### Analytics Integration

**Privacy-Focused Analytics**:
```jsx
// Vercel Analytics for performance insights
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';

// Minimal tracking with user privacy respect
<Analytics />
<SpeedInsights />
```

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: MDX Content Management

**Problem**: Needed flexible content authoring while maintaining type safety and performance.

**Solution**: Implemented a hybrid approach combining file-based content with dynamic metadata extraction:

```typescript
// Type-safe content management
export type BlogPostMetadata = {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  date: string;
  tags?: string[];
  slug: string;
};

// Dynamic content discovery
export async function getBlogPostMetadata(slug: string): Promise<BlogPostMetadata> {
  const { frontmatter } = await import(`@/markdown/blog/${slug}.mdx`);
  return {
    title: frontmatter.title,
    description: frontmatter.description,
    date: frontmatter.date,
    tags: frontmatter.tags,
    slug,
  };
}
```

### Challenge 2: Dark Mode Implementation

**Problem**: Needed seamless theme switching without flash of incorrect theme.

**Solution**: Server-side theme detection with client-side hydration:

```jsx
// Theme provider with system preference detection
<ThemeProvider
  defaultTheme="dark"
  enableSystem
  attribute="class"
  disableTransitionOnChange
>
```

### Challenge 3: Content Categorization

**Problem**: Organizing diverse content types (articles, case studies, project deep-dives) without complex CMS.

**Solution**: Tag-based automatic categorization system that scales with content growth.
