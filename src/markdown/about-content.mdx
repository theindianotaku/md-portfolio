## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with **6 years of experience** crafting accessible, scalable, and user-focused web solutions. Known for a meticulous approach, strong collaboration, and a keen eye for detail in both design and architecture.

My unconventional journey started with a Metallurgical Engineering degree from IIT Roorkee, where web development projects during college sparked what would become a full-fledged passion and career. What drives me isn't just writing codeâ€”it's creating digital experiences that work for everyone. Whether it's implementing WCAG 2.1 compliance or building developer tools, I believe technology should be inclusive and intuitive.

After 6 incredible years at HackerRank growing from intern to Senior Engineer, I took a personal hiatus in May 2024 to focus on my health and well-being. Sometimes the best career move is knowing when to pause, reflect, and prioritize what truly matters.

Now, over a year later, I'm back with renewed energy, clarity, and determination. I know the path ahead won't be easy, but I'm ready to put my best foot forward and tackle whatever challenges come my way. If anything, this break has reinforced my passion for creating meaningful digital experiences and reminded me why I fell in love with engineering in the first place.
