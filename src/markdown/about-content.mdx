## About Me

üëã Hi there! I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with **6 years of experience** crafting accessible, scalable, and user-focused web solutions. Known for a meticulous approach, strong collaboration, and a keen eye for detail in both design and architecture. My journey began with web development projects during my time at IIT Roorkee, evolving into a full-fledged passion and career. Now returning with renewed focus and adaptability after a personal hiatus.

What drives me isn't just writing code‚Äîit's creating digital experiences that work for everyone. Whether it's implementing WCAG 2.1 compliance across thousands of problem descriptions or building developer tools that make other engineers' lives easier, I believe technology should be inclusive and intuitive.

## My Journey So Far

When I reflect on my path in software development, it feels like yesterday when I was trying to figure out what a DOM was. My journey officially began at HackerRank, where I've had the privilege of growing from an intern to a Senior Software Engineer.

### The Beginning: Intern Days (Jun - Aug 2018)

Fresh out of college with a Metallurgical Engineering degree (yes, you read that right), I stepped into HackerRank as an intern. With more enthusiasm than experience, I was handed their internal UIKit to revitalize. I still remember the mix of excitement and terror when I realized I would be working on components used by other developers.

During these three months, I built my first Toast notification component and created a React wrapper for CKEditor - not earth-shattering work, but it was *my* work. I also got my first taste of developer tooling by setting up linting configurations that would later become standards across the organization. Looking back, what seemed like simple tasks laid the foundation for what would become core strengths in my career.

Oh, and I once built an entire intern website overnight because our **CTO Hari** bet I couldn't do it. Spoiler: I did. ‚úåÔ∏è

### Finding My Footing: SDE-I (Aug 2018 - Jun 2020)

As a full-time engineer, I was thrown into the deep end with the migration of HackerRank's Screen product from Backbone.js to React. This was my first experience with a large-scale migration, and it taught me more about application architecture than any course ever could.

During this time, I developed a passion for theming and dark mode implementation. What started as "Hey, can you look into adding a dark theme?" turned into leading organization-wide initiatives on standardizing our component library and ensuring theme consistency across products.

One of my proudest achievements during this period was convincing the team to move away from jQuery. I remember making a presentation with far too many animated slides showcasing vanilla JavaScript alternatives. It wasn't just about following trends - it was about building a more maintainable codebase that would scale with our needs.

### Growing Responsibilities: SDE-II (Jul 2020 - Dec 2021)

As I moved into a more senior role, the pandemic hit, and our priorities shifted. Remote work became the norm, and our platform needed to adapt to support remote hiring processes. This led to my work on proctoring solutions and improving communication between components in our platform.

This was also when I first dove deep into accessibility. What started as a compliance requirement became a personal mission. I led the effort to make HackerRank Screen accessible according to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards - a journey that transformed how I view software development. Working with Deque Systems on our first accessibility audit opened my eyes to the importance of inclusive design.

The transition from polling architecture to WebSockets for our long-running tasks was another highlight - seeing real-time updates flow in smoothly during high-stress testing scenarios was immensely satisfying.

### Leading and Mentoring: Senior Engineer (Jan 2022 - Apr 2024)

My final role at HackerRank allowed me to focus on three areas I'm passionate about: accessibility, developer experience, and mentorship.

I led accessibility improvements for over 6,200 problem descriptions, fixing issues in content that had been generated through WYSIWYG editors. This meant creating systems to identify, categorize, and fix problems at scale - work that directly impacted thousands of candidates using our platform.

Customizing VSCode for our platform needs and standardizing iframe communication using Penpal allowed me to improve the developer experience both internally and for candidates using our platform.

Perhaps most rewarding was mentoring younger engineers. Seeing them grow from struggling with basic React concepts to confidently shipping features gave me a sense of purpose beyond my own contributions.
