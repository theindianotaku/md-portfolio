## Who I Am

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with **6 years of experience** crafting accessible, scalable, and user-focused web solutions. Known for a meticulous approach, strong collaboration, and a keen eye for detail in both design and architecture. My journey began with web development projects during my time at IIT Roorkee, evolving into a full-fledged passion and career. Now returning with renewed focus and adaptability after a personal hiatus.

What drives me isn't just writing codeâ€”it's creating digital experiences that work for everyone. Whether it's implementing WCAG 2.1 compliance across thousands of problem descriptions or building developer tools that make other engineers' lives easier, I believe technology should be inclusive and intuitive.

**Programming Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Sass

**Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Redux, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Formik

**Accessibility:** Implemented WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for inclusive, accessible designs.

**Performance Optimization:** Improved real-time responsiveness with WebSocket migration, optimized collaboration in web IDEs, instrumented performance metrics, and enhanced UI reflow for accessibility.

**IDE Customization & Embedding:** Experience working with and customizing web IDEs like che-theia, JupyterLab and openvscode-server for embedded development workflows.

**Testing Expertise:** Strong focus on unit and snapshot testing using Jest and React Testing Library.

**CI/CD Contributions:** Developed pipelines for automated testing, code quality enforcement, and coverage reporting.

**Professional Strengths:** Detail-oriented, adaptable, and pragmatic team player who values precision, thoughtful collaboration, and continuous learning.
